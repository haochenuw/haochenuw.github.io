I am a software engineer on the Applied Privacy Technologies team at Facebook. Previously, I was a Senior Researcher in the Cryptography and Privacy research group at Microsoft Research, Redmond. My research interests include fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and secure multiparty computation (MPC). I work on both the theoretical and applied aspects. I enjoy combining and optimizing all available techniques to build solutions for different privacy preserving computation tasks.

Prior to joining MSR, I obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics at University of Washington, with concentration on computational 
number theory. My advisor was the awesome [William Stein](https://wstein.org/).
